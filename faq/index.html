        <h3 id="products">Products</h3>
<p><strong>Are all the products naturally dyed and handwoven?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Are these products available in Desi stores as well?</strong></p>
<p>Some of these are available only here, some are available in Desi stores as well.</p>
<p><strong>What is so unique about these products?</strong></p>
<p>These products are made by Charaka Rural Womens' Co-operative in a village in Karnataka. All the products are naturally dyed and handwoven, ensuring they are eco-friendly and handmade.</p>
<p><strong>Are the clothes 100% cotton?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Do you use organic cotton?</strong></p>
<p>No, we do not.</p>
<p><strong>Are these products Khadi?</strong></p>
<p>No, they are handloom, meaning the weaving process is by hand, whereas the yarn is mill made. For a deeper understanding of handloom, <a href="https://desitrust.org/handloom/">please click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why are only some products listed here and not the complete collection?</strong></p>
<p>We are slowly getting started online. In the next few months, you will see more collections.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the product I ordered home not look exatly like how I saw in the photographs online?</strong></p>
<p>Owing to the quality of naturally dyed fabric, the colours might not render as an exact match in photographs. Moreoever, depending on the natural dye ingredients used, the weather conditions, each batch might vary in their colour shade. Rest assured that the product you are receiving is of good quality and is unique, which is a feature of handmade products.</p>
<p><strong>How can I be sure I am choosing the right size?</strong></p>
<p>If you have not purchased DESI earlier, please feel free to consult our customer care team on Whatsapp before purchase and ask for a size chart.</p>
<p><strong>Will the products shrink after first wash?</strong></p>
<p>Unstitched products like dupatta, stole, towels etc. tend to shrink upto 5%. Garments are pre-shrunk but a slight shrinkage is observed in some cases.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to starch the clothes?</strong></p>
<p>Not required, the handwoven cotton tends to become softer with each wash. If absolutely required, in case of thinner fabric, a mild starch can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Will the colours fade after washing?</strong></p>
<p>All natural dyed fabrics are prone to bleeding in the first 2-3 washes. The fabric tends to gradually fade over a period of time. Indigo producuts must be dried and stored away from light. Natural fading in places exposed to light as well as at the folds might occur over time.</p>
